Movie Genre Classification

This project addresses the challenge of multi-label classification using natural language data. It involves building a model that takes movie plot summaries as input and predicts one or more genres such as Action, Comedy, Drama, or Sci-Fi. Textual features are extracted using techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings, and classification is performed using algorithms such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Support Vector Machines (SVM). The project highlights the use of NLP for understanding and classifying creative content.
